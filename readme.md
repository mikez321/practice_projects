# Practice Projects
I created this repo as a single place to do practice projects and not end up with excessive repos in my GH.  Most of them are from Turing's extension projects, but I'll dabble in a few things as well.  This is really a place for me to keep up my coding skills, keep my brain doing something, and to practice using my new HHKB!
