# Practice Projects
This repo holds ~~all~~ most of the work I have done since graduating from the [Turing School of Software and Design](https://turing.io/). Below is a brief description of what you can find here:

### Turing Project: Linked List
We had briefly touched on this project during my time at Turing but it wasn't until I graduated I had time to complete it.  It explores the linked list data structure.  It is built using Ruby and Minitest for testing.

### Turing Project: Binary Search
Similar to linked list, this is a Turing project which builds a binary search data structure.  Again, Minitest and Ruby were used when completing this project.

### Turing Project: Complete Me
The final Turing project I completed was a retrieval tree (trie) data structure by building an autocomplete system.  The biggest accomplishment I had during this project was really getting my head around recursion.  As with all other Turing Projects, this was built with Minitest and Ruby.

### Casidoo Challenges
I subscribe to Cassidy Williams' newsletter and started doing her little code challenges for fun.  I started doing these with Ruby/Minitest, but after learning more Python, I did quite a few of them in Python and testing with Unittest or Pytest.

### Other Challenges
These are code challenges I found on the internet, had during job interviews, or are from [check.io](https://checkio.org/).  Of note in here is a folder called [fizzbuzz_objects](https://github.com/mikez321/practice_projects/tree/main/other_challenges/fizzbuzz_objects).  I had done Fizzbuzz in some really easy ways, but wanted to do it in a slightly more elegant way.  In this version, every number of Fizzbuzz is an object and each object "shouts" out its number, fizz, buzz, or fizzbuzz.

### All your Rebase
Git Rebase practice.  I got much more comfortable using interactive rebase to fix minor commits ('Capitalize first letter of readme' types of commits) and also practiced rebase workflow instead of merge.

### Python Things
I bought a Udemy course for Python and spent 3 weeks learning how the language worked.  It was my first attempt at learning a new language and I got to apply everything I learned in Ruby to quickly pick up Python.

### Waterdrops Exploration
A quick revisit of Rails.  All this really did was remind me how Rails worked, revisit concepts like routes and gemfiles.  In the end I got a homepage working with an embeded google map.  It was also the first time I had implemented (or heard of) Git Submodules.
