# Practice Projects
This is a repo for doing random practice projects, code challenges and things like that so I'm not just sitting around forgetting everything I learned this year!  It is getting a little full so here's a quick rundown of what it contains:

__Turing Projects__

I completed a few extra Turing projects.  I built a linked list based on the Oregon Trail game, and then built a Binary Search Tree.  I also explored the Trie data structure by building the foundation of an autocomplete program.  (As a bonus I used quite a bit of recursion in that one!).  All of those projects were done in Ruby and built using TDD with Minitest.

The idea behind using Ruby for all of these is that I was learning new data types and concepts and wanted to figure those out and get used to writing code again.

__Casidoo Challenges__

I subscribe to Cassidy Williams' newsletter and started doing her little code challenges for fun.  I again did them using Ruby and Minitest.

__Other Challenges__

Just random things I found on the internet.

__All your Rebase__

Here I did some practice work with Rebasing.  It really set me up for success later on and after doing this project I started squashing commits and rewording things all over the place.  No more stupid "Fix readme typo" or "Undo change" immediately followed by "Redo change" commits!  Yay!  As an added bonus, I inadvertently created an annoying merge conflict so I got to merge conflict and put out a git fire at the same time as rebasing!

__Python Things__

After a little bit, I decided to go ahead and learn some Python for real.  I wrote an API (Oh Crop!) in Python Flask, but haven't done any Python coding in a while.  When I was asked if I could do a code challenge in Python and had to be like... "Oh, no." it made me realize I should probably spend some real time with it and bought a Udemy course.  It starts off pretty basic with "Hello, World!" but in the interest of getting the most out of it I'm going through it from the beginning and not just assuming I should jump into the deep end.  Its a little boring at first, but I'm sure it will get more challenging as I go on!
