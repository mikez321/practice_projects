# Waterdrops Exploration
~~This is a Rails app I created mainly to remember how to use Rails!  At the time of creating this, I haven't worked in Rails in a little bit and I'm about to start a little side project so I want to be sure I remmber how it works.~~

This was supposed to be me re-exploring Rails and doing some recon work for an upcoming project.  What _this_ folder turned into was a lesson into __git submodules__.  So, after a little confusion, I figured out how to set up wd_explore as a submodule of my Practice Projects repo.  Fun!
