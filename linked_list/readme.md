# Linked List!

This is a project from Turing to explore the linked list data structure.  The original project can be found [here](https://backend.turing.io/module1/projects/perilous_journey).  It is listed as a Mod1 project, and after completing Turing I was able to do this in a few hours over the span of two days.  Exciting to see how far I've come!
