# Notes from Udemy Python Course:
* All python functions end with parenthesis

### Strings and Variables
* Get input from user with `input()` method.  Pretty slick.
* The 'escape' character `\`

__Naming Variables__
* Must begin with a letter (upper or lower case) or a _
* They can contain numbers
* They are case sensitive
* They are assigned using an `=`
* You would say that 'this string (or whatever) is bound to the variable (whatever)'

__Types in Python__
* find a data type with the `type()` method.
* variables can easily be reassigned just like in Ruby (apparently that's not the case for languages like C or Java... weird... who knew)

__Python is a 'strongly typed' language__

What does that even mean???

In this example we try to concatenate a string and an int.  It generates an error saying it can't do that.  _Oh, and one nice thing here... it has a semi useful error message with a line number and everything!_
