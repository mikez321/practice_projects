Here's a text file!
I'm going to add some lines of code to it.  I'm committing after every sentence.  That way I can do a quick interactive rebase before I get into the whole... branch rebase thing.

Ok, I squashed all those commits into a single one using an interactive rebase.  Now I want to try making some changes and rebasing a branch before I merge it.  I'm currently on the main branch.

And now to keep this dialogue going, I just made changes to the rebase branch.  These two branches are starting to get pretty diverged!

Now, this is the rebase branch.  I just made some changes to the main branch, and this branch does not include those.  Likewise, the main branch doesn't have the text found in this rebase branch!  Oh noes!  What shall we do?

Well, don't worry!  I'm going to rebase these two branches together!  I'll have to fix some merge conflicts, but my next move is to rebase to master, fix issues, and then merge it all back together and PR it!  Let's see how it goes!
