# Rando Challenges!
These are other random challenges I have come across.  I created this section of my practice projects if I'm looking for something specific.  For example, I wanted to make sure I could do things recursively so I found a challenge to return the first capitalized letter in a string.  I first solved it iteratively and then solved it recursively!
