# Another Fizzbuzz?  Explain yourself!
I recently did fizzbuzz as a flow control exercise while learning python.  It made me realize I've only ever done it with flow control.  So, I want to do it with testing and with objects that can respond.

This is loosely based on the State Machine lecture that Jeff Casimir gave at Turing back in February which I absolutely loved.  I want write this in Ruby and have each node be an object that tells us about itself!  Be nice to your objects!  Let your objects be heard!

Also, after writing a bunch of python code over the past week or so, it will be fun to get back to writing some Ruby code!
